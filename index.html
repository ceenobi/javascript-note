    <h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Original JavaScript ES1 ES2 ES3 (1997-1999)</li>
        <li>The First Main Revision ES5 (2009)</li>
        <li>The Second Revision ES6 (2015)</li>
        <li>All Yearly Additions (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between script tags.</p>
    <p>Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows
        down the display.</p>
    <p>External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages. JavaScript files have the
        file extension .js. To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of
        a tag</p>

    <p>Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It separates HTML and code</li>
        <li>It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain</li>
        <li>Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads</li>
        <li>To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.</li>
        <li>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().</li>
        <li>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().</li>
        <li>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods
        by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional:</p>
    <p>For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.</p>
    <p>JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods. You cannot access output devices from JavaScript. The
        only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current
        window.</p>
    <h3>Statements in Javascript</h3>
    <p>A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.</p>
    <p>JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <h3>JavaScript Keywords</h3>
    <p>JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
    </p>
    <p>var Declares a variable
        let Declares a block variable
        const Declares a block constant
        if Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
        switch Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
        for Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
        function Declares a function
        return Exits a function
        try Implements error handling to a block of statements</p>
    <p>JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.</p>
    <h3>JavaScript Identifiers / Names</h3>
    <p>dentifiers are JavaScript names. Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.The rules for
        legal names are the same in most programming languages.A JavaScript name must begin with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A letter (A-Z or a-z)</li>
        <li>A dollar sign ($)</li>
        <li>Or an underscore (_)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers
        from numbers.</p>
    <h3>JavaScript is Case Sensitive</h3>
    <p>All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:
    </p>
    <h3>JavaScript and Camel Case</h3>
    <p>We have different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:</p>
    <p>Hyphens: first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city. Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved
        for subtractions.</p>
    <p>Underscore: first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.</p>
    <p>Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case): FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.</p>
    <p>Lower Camel Case: JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName,
        lastName, masterCard, interCity.</p>
    <h3>The Assignment Operator</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.</p>
    <p>x = x + 5. it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.</p>
    <p>The "equal to" operator is written like "==" in JavaScript.</p>
